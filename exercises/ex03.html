        <h2>Overview</h2>
        Order-Sol, also known as Holy Order-Sol (and often abbreviated to HOS), is a quick, momentum-oriented offensive
        monster with a unique Charge system which allows him to power up his specials, making them much stronger. He
        pressures his opponent at close range, forcing poor decisions, then reading their next move and punishing them
        for it. Smart management of his Charge system is key to implementing this strategy to its fullest potential.
        Once in, Order-Sol's pressure is limitless; almost every string is plus on block thanks to Charge Cancelling,
        forcing the opponent into a series of guessing games that only ends when he's pushed out.

        <h2>Cons and Workarounds</h2>
        Unfortunately, in exchange for this power, Order-Sol's buttons are generally stubby. Unlike his present-self Sol
        Badguy, his 6P is relegated to a sluggish frametrap/oki tool and his DP Storm Viper is slow. This forces him to
        rely on preemptive air defense, which can leave him vulnerable against opponents with a wide range of
        approaches. Getting in can be tricky, but there are ways to manage. His high speed and mobility allow him to
        weave around the opponent's pokes or feint potential approach options, creating a very real threat bubble that
        some can struggle to challenge. Combined with his low jump arc, he can switch from contesting space to
        immediately approaching at an unusually shallow angle. Against opponents who'd rather stay away, he can instead
        start Charging in neutral to force a response.

        <h2>Charge Mechanic</h2>

        Order-Sol's specials and Overdrives are governed by the Charge Gauge.

        The Charge Gauge can be increased in two ways: by using his Charge special to fill the Charge Gauge manually
        over time, or by tapping D after using a special (other than Charge and Charge Burst) to use Action Charge, a
        maneuver that refills a fixed amount of the Charge Gauge.

        At higher levels of Charge, all of Order-Sol's specials and Overdrives become stronger overall. Each gains more
        hits, as well as added effects such as knocking down, extending combos, and doing more damage as well as
        becoming safer. Some excellent examples of his level 3 specials' bonuses include becoming jump-cancellable,
        extremely advantageous, or just far more damaging. Upon use, the Charge Gauge drains slowly, letting Order-Sol
        use multiple moves of the same level mid-string and leading to an extensively creative combo game.

        Should Order-Sol not desire to spend his accumulated Charge Gauge, he can use Charge Keep to use the lowest
        level versions of his specials at any time. This can be done by pressing the D button at the same time the move
        is performed (or by holding the D button prior to the input): to Charge Keep Blockhead Buster, for example, the
        input would be 236D~P. This technique is especially important in order to maintain pressure and advantage
        without wasting Charge, or possibly gaining more by mixing the technique with Action Charge FRC.
