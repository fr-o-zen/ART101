        <p>
            Hey, my name is Harry (pronouns are he/him) and I’m from the Sierra Nevada foothills area. Im a second year in the AGPM major, and I want to go into visual development/design for video games. I’m an avid fighting game enjoyer as well! 
            I’ve taken a college level programming course in high school, and dabbled in Gamemaker software and Python, but aside from that, I have a very basic and limited understanding of programming. 
            I’m excited to learn and looking forward to meeting you all :) 
        </p>
